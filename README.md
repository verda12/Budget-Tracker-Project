# Budget-Tracker-Project
This is a c program based budget tracker system which allow user to track their income, saving and expenses.

A simple console-based money management system built in C.

# 📌 Overview

The Budget Tracker is a menu-driven console application written in C that helps users record their income and expenses, set a monthly spending limit, view financial reports, and calculate total savings.
All data is stored permanently in text files, so the user’s financial records remain saved even after closing the program.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as:

Structures

File Handling

Loops & Conditions

Modular Functions

Data Persistence

Menu-driven design
